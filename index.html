        <p>
            <b>Phantom limb pain</b> is not just a question of feeling, it is a bodily memory of the trauma that the
            body has
            incurred. This <i>parallels</i> <b>the body of Gaza</b>, Palestine, where being <b>amputated</b> into rubble
            under the decades of
            systemic occupation, restriction, destruction and genocide. On the ground of amputated land, <b>a group of
                bodies in Gaza</b> is experiencing a <b>collective pain</b> of no longer existing land, culture, home
            and community,
            they used to innately own just as their body part they are born with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both the experiences talk about a profound, unconscious desire to be one with the nerve system, the other
            with the land. As an amputee continues to feel the absence of a limb, an affected community suffers from a
            <b>‘phantom pain’</b> of absence, the desire to go back to the known territory of liberty and identity that
            they
            used to take as a right as a part of their body.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The act of digging</b> is <i>not just a physical activity but is also a concept of searching,
                investigating and
                reaching for memory or space</i> to <b>retrieve</b> what was taken. The tunnels in underground Gaza are
            the <i>nerve pathways that
                feel for a missing limb,</i> hollow negative spaces excavated and created intentionally, to contain new
            memories
            and intentions as a vessel -like the body refusing to accept loss, <i>intention of <b>refusing to accept</b>
                forced
                absence.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this sense, the act of digging is a way of retrieving the <b>embodied memories</b> in the same manner
            that the
            feeling of a phantom limb is the way of one’s body trying to seek for what was there. In these <b>parallel
                two
                cases,</b> that of bodily pain or physical excavation, there is a persistent memory, a strong will to
            act, and
            an <i>embodied claim</i> of existence against forced deletion.

        <h1>Chapter 1 [Head] : Phantom Limb Pain</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Phantom limb pain(PLP)</b> is a condition in which the brain still generates sensations
            that a person believes to still be in a missing amputated limb. Despite the physical absence of the limb,
            individuals experience vivid and often painful sensations as if the limb still exists. These sensations,
            including pain, tingling, itching, or even the feeling of movement, can occur long after the amputation,
            causing
            a disconnection between the body’s physical reality and the brain’s perception<i>(Fuchs et al. p.1)</i>. PLP
            is
            not a
            simple neurological problem, but a complex interaction between the body and the mind that remembers the
            whole.
        </p>
        As Fuchs et al. state, ,<b>“Where the body remembers what has been lost.”</b> This quote captures the
        essence of PLP: it
        is not only a perception but a form of embodied memory. The body, in a way, does not want to lose the limb, and
        thus continues to remember the limb in painful and non-painful ways. The inherent passivity in this experience
        is the fact that the body’s memory of the lost limb is involuntary; the pain or even the feeling of presence is
        the aftermath of a trauma.

        <h2 class="mainquote" onclick="toggleText(this)">The Neurological Basis of PLP?</h2>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <p class="EssayBodyhidden-text">
            The neurological basis of PLP is based on how the brain processes the sensory information from the body.
            When a limb is amputated, the brain does not delete the neural pathways associated with it. Instead, these
            neural circuits keep the “memory” of the lost limb and may continue to fire and cause the pain or the
            feeling of presence. This is related to the somatosensory memories of the affected limb, sensations that the
            brain stores even when the limb is no longer present in the body (Fuchs et al. p.5).
        </p>
        <p class="EssayBodyhidden-text">
            Pre-amputation pain is also a trigger for PLP. Studies show that the pain that a patient experiences before
            the amputation can persist as PLP after the surgery. This means that the brain does not simply delete the
            memory of pain from the affected limb, but instead keeps a neural imprint of pain that makes the pain seem
            continuous. This relationship is theory-driven and has been evidenced through retrospective accounts which
            state that the phantom limb sensations are similar to the pain or other sensations that the patient felt in
            the limb before it was amputated (Fuchs et al. p.5). The body’s memory of pre-amputation pain can be in such
            a way that it persists and haunts the individual, and thus, PLP is both a psychological and physical
            phenomenon.

        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <p class="EssayBodyhidden-text">
            PLP is not just a <b>passive perception,</b> but it is <b>an active, though instinctive,</b> psychosomatic
            expression of
            trauma. <b>It is both inhabitation and use of the space of the body.</b> The phenomenon shows how the body
            is
            closely related to its perception of integrity. Although the limb is missing, the mind and body still have a
            connection to it, and hence, there is a kind of “phantom sensation”, a feeling of being there when there is
            none. <i>This is a painful memento of loss, not just a transient one, but a lasting one that does not want
                to
                be forgotten.</i>
        </p>
        <p class="EssayBodyhidden-text">
            In this way, PLP goes beyond the physical, however it becomes <b>traumatic.</b> The brain’s persistence in
            recalling a missing limb is a manifestation of the body’s refusal to acknowledge the absence, as if the body
            itself is <b>fighting the idea of finality in loss.</b> The trauma is not only felt at the time of the
            amputation,
            but it also reverberates especially when the patient still feels the limb. Thus, the pain or the feeling of
            the phantom limb is not only a neurologic event, however it is <b>a symbol of the body’s trauma</b> and its
            attempt
            to keep what is no longer there.
        </p>
        <p class="EssayBodyhidden-text">
            This embodied memory, closely linked to both the somatic and the psychological, is a crucial aspect of why
            PLP is compelling to be considered as an bodily experience. The persistence of the phantom limb is an
            example of how the body is scarred by the trauma of losing a limb and how the <b>memory of pain</b> or
            presence
            <b>continues to haunt</b> the individual’s life even after the limb has been amputated.

            The human body shows deep interactions between physical and mental elements when experiencing traumatic loss
            through phantom limb pain. <b>Deeply rooted and embodied.</b> PLP shows us through its <b>underlying
                passivity</b> that the body maintains awareness
            of the missing limb while the mind along with neural patterns continue to retain memories of the lost limb
            after amputation. The physical memory of pain functions beyond neurological responses because it creates an
            internal experience that perpetually reminds the body about past trauma. PLP demonstrates how both the
            physical body and mental self resist forgetting through the scars left by experience of loss.

        <b>Gaza as a city, as body, as a group of bodies, as a limb,</b> is being amputated, throughout decades of

        community and
        freedom, and its social rupture which is now unwillingly fragmented into pieces of rubble (Shalhoub, 2024). The
        systematic erasure of
        cultural elements has brought a disconnection, where the continuity of life, history, and heritage has been
        violently interrupted (Shalhoub, 2024).

        <h2>The Significance of The Act of Digging in Gaza</h2>
        <p class="Paragraph14px">
            The act of digging in Gaza is <i>more than just a physical activity</i>, however it embodies a form of
            <b>resistance</b>, and a search for missing fragments they have unwillingly lost. This particular form of
            digging a tunnel in
            Gaza could be seen as a type of <b>reaction to the amputation</b> that exists in this context. According to
            the
            testimonies from Gazans who has been to, or actually used the existing tunnel underground Gaza for certain
            reason, these tunnels were dug and built from the aim to <b>re-establish their connection</b> with lost
            freedom
            such as a right to travel without going through multiple checkpoints, or easier transportation of goods
            -materials for craft coming from adjacent countries such as Egypt Cairo- and crafts (Gharbiha, 2024;
            QamariaCraftsman, 2024).

            <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        </div>


        <p class="Paragraph14px">
            While digging a tunnel could be seen as a response to a lack of mobility or a transportation route, it also
            contains a significant meaning throughout their tunnel networks. Within the context of Gaza, the tunnels are
            not just existing as a passage, however they are being <b>a vessel</b> where a community engages in a
            <b>reclamation
                of the past,</b> a way to resist being erased from history (Gharbiha, 2024). These tunnels become
            metaphysical
            channels through
            which memories of pre-occupation life, familial bonds, and continuing the cultural practices including
            crafts, despite the surrounding systemic violences to interrupt and erase these connections, linking the
            entire body of Gaza.
        </p>

        <p class="Paragraph14px">
            Digging conceives a concept of <b>outwarding activity</b> which <b>opposes</b> the <b>underlying
                passivity</b> of phantom limb
            pain (PLP). The experience of PLP emerges from the passive memories of lost things that the body stores in
            its sensory experiences (Fuchs et al. p.5). The intentional process of digging functions as an active
            pursuit to find things
            that have been taken. PLP demonstrates an <b>internal battle</b> with loss and absence while <b>the act of
                digging in
                Gaza</b> functions as <b>an external activity</b> of <b>refusal to passively remain and accepting</b>
            forced disappearance.

        <h1>Chapter 3 [Knee] : Defining The Parallel</h1>
        <h2>Inception of Digging In-Depth</h2>
        To categorise <b>parallel aspects</b> between <b>PLP</b> and <b>the act of digging in Gaza</b>, it is necessary
        to
        analyse and
        clarify key terms within both contexts of PLP and Gaza. These terms <i>– 1. Embodied trauma, 2. Amputation, 3.
            Phantom, 4. The act of digging, and 5. Prosthetics–</i> play a central role in understanding how both
        phenomena
        can be seen as an insistence of not to accept the loss of something whether it is a physical part of a body or
        the social, cultural, and political fabric of one land and community. From analysing these concepts within both
        specific contexts, it is able to find the deeper links between the experience of PLP and the sufferings of
        communities in Gaza.

                Within the context of PLP, embodied trauma is the pain and sensorial experiences that occur both before
                and after amputation. This pain is not only physical but also psychological, linked to the memory of the
                missing body part. The trauma is due to the sensory system of the body trying to make sense of the loss
                and the brain still ‘feeling’ sensations that are no longer there. It is observed in sensation
                experiences where the individual remembers the limb even though it is no longer there and still
                experiences pain, itching or tingling as if the limb was still there (Fuchs et al. p.1).

            <p class="hidden-text2">
                In Gaza, embodied trauma is also different but similar in that, it also applies across generations.
                Trauma is not just an individuals’ bodily experience, however it is more likely <b>collectively getting
                    haunted</b> and feeling pain, and it is <b>rooted</b> in the experience of displacement after being
                amputated from
                own houses <i>"one have built bit by bit"</i>, repeating violence and oppression that are being repeated
                for
                decades (Shalhoub, 2024). People of Gaza are <b>seeing and feeling the phantom</b> of what has been torn
                out
                from them.

            <p class="hidden-text2">
                As Nadera Shalhoub explains in the video “There is So Much Love in Palestine”, the trauma of losing
                homes, family members and basic rights as a human being is internalised in the daily acts of resistance.
                <i>[–Explained in detail in the video, please click on the floating video at the right edge of the
                    screen.]</i>
                The trauma is experienced in action (bodily) embodied experiences where the community engages in the
                process of digging (- to be
                elaborated at 4. The Act of Digging) as a way of resisting and affirming their presence against the
                forced loss of their land and identity. Just as with phantom limb pain, <b>the act of digging</b> is
                <b>a reaction to an unresolved,

                Amputation in PLP is the actual removal of a body part, usually a limb. It is <b>an irreversible
                    loss</b> that
                the body has to learn to cope with (Fuchs et al. p.1). However, even after the amputation, the brain
                does not simply forget the lost part, it holds onto memories of it, which results in what is known as
                phantom sensations or pain (Fuchs et al. p.5). Amputation, in this context, is not only physical but is
                also psychological, as the body and mind are left to cope with the loss of something that used to be a
                part of one’s body and that one used to be able to function with.

                systemic violence and geopolitical restrictions throughout the years (Shalhoub, 2024). The forced
                displacement from their homeland creates a sensory experience of <b>disconnection from their
                    familiarities.</b>The people of Gaza, as amputees do, experience the similar pain coming from the

                The term <b>“phantom”</b> in PLP is the missing limb, the part of the body that is no longer there
                physically
                but is still felt by the person (Fuchs et al. p.1-2). It stands for the brain’s capacity to keep the
                memories of the lost part in the body map even when the part is no longer physically present (Fuchs et
                al. p.1-2). The phantom limb is not just a neurologic response, but it is <b>a manifestation of the
                    brain’s
                    refusal to accept the absence</b> of what used to be. The experience of the phantom limb is an
                embodied
                memory of the former completeness of one’s body, which continues to haunt the individual even when the
                body is physically whole.

                <b>Gaza itself is a concept of “phantom”.</b> The land has unwillingly lost both its ground and cultural
                identity and people's sense of self. The people of Gaza experience <b>a phantom connection</b> to their
                ‘home’
                under the circumstance of their land remaining under occupation while their houses get demolished and
                their freedom remains restricted (Shalhoub, 2024).

                in plastic bags (Shalhoub, 2024). He is still feeling the presence of his son. He is still seeing the

                The “phantom” in this context describes the <b>enduring emotional bond</b> between people and their land

                futures and interrupted relationships because of separations within family and deaths (Shalhoub, 2024).
                This “phantom” enacts more than a lost body part since it <b>embodies the sharing memory of people</b>
                who
                maintain their <b>connection to their lost sense of home.</b>

            <p class="hidden-text">
                In the context of PLP, the word <b>'digging'</b> is an analogy for the <b>continuous process of looking
                    for
                    something</b> which has been missing. In this case, the search is for the lost limb. The individual
                with PLP
                is always <b>‘digging’ into their own sensory memories</b>, searching for the limb that is no longer
                there.
                This search is a persistent, embodied action of <b>the mind attempting</b> to come to terms with the
                loss, and
                <b>reconnect with the missing part</b> of the body. In this case, the act of digging is, therefore,
                physical
                and mental, and is rooted in the trauma of the loss and the brain’s ongoing attempt to find the missing
                piece.

        <h1>Chapter 5 [Ground] : To Conclude and To Continue</h1>
        <h2>Questioning the Temporality of Spatial and Bodily Sensations</h2>
        PLP and the act of digging demonstrate an <b>ongoing conflict between temporal experiences and enduring
            structures
            that reflect the struggle to retrieve what has been lost.</b> The body in PLP maintains a lasting memory of
        pain
        which continues to exist even after amputation thus extending the experience of loss. The feeling remains across
        time and space because it exists within both mental awareness and physical flesh. Through the process of digging
        people strive to recover both lost physical territories and historical memories as the present moment meets
        their desire to restore what has been permanently transformed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spatial sensations in Gaza experience temporal changes because of the continuous process of destruction
            followed by temporal reconstruction. The process of digging functions as a dialogue between the empty spaces
            after
            countless destructions and the physical exploration of redefined extra spaces dug underground. It contains
            dual purposes while it builds literal underground passages but also simultaneously fills up alternative
            stories within subtracted spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            The phantom limb pain and the act of digging both require <b>continuous interaction within the relationship
                between what exists and what does not exist,</b> and between <b>what has been lost and what has been
                resisted to be
                reclaimed.</b> <b>The temporal nature of spatial and bodily sensations demonstrates that all losses
                remain present
                in certain forms.</b> The denial or refusal of accepting lost things leads to keep ongoing experiences
            of
            resistance happening within both physical body parts and the context of the land, home and communities.

            Imagining the context of liberation in Gaza, all displaced groups of bodies return to their home, however
            everything is destroyed into rubble, requiring tonnes of repair. It is re-building a city, re-stitching a
            body, a limb from scratch where presence of home and spaces of familiarities remain only as a phantom, in
            the memories. Quoting Kader Attia, Repair is Returning back to its original state. The concept of repair as
            a return to the original, is not by erasing scars, but repairing is by embracing trauma as part of the
            embodied memory.
        </p>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>

        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <p class="EssayBodyhidden-text">
            “Repair defines a space through time. In other words, there is no way to understand repair without the
            wounds that were inflicted in the past. Repair is actually an oxymoron. When we think repair, we actually
            think injury. The injuries are always somewhere, they cannot be evacuated. This notion derives from the
            Latin "reparare," which means to restore, that is to return to the original state of the thing or idea. In
            reality you never return something to an original state. You return only to the idea of an original state
            (Attia, 2022).”

        </p>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <p>
            Although the ‘return’ happens, it is impossible to rewind back to the original state before all the trauma
            and amputations, which are irreversible bodily experiences. No matter how much will be rebuilt, re-stitching
            amputated limbs back to an original whole body as a Gaza and erasing all embodied memories is also
            impossible.
        </p>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <p class="EssayBodyhidden-text">
            “These two states of the injured object and of the repaired object are likewise defined by time. Time is
            space, for without a movement through time we would not move through space either. This may sound very
            philosophical, but there is no denying it. However, repair, particularly for an artist, creates an
            interstitial space in which we can elaborate a new and deeper understanding of the object and the world in
            which we live. I am deeply convinced that repair can help us understand the blind spots of modernity. This
            understanding that repairing an object isn't meant to erase the damage or injury is not an invention of art,
            but, as I said, deeply rooted in pre-modern societies (Attia, 2022).”
        </p>
        <p>
            As Attia mentions, here two different concepts collide but blend together – Time and Space. The group of
            bodies who have already gone through multiple amputations from the body of Gaza have passed through the
            ‘time’ of pain, phantoms, and embodied traumas. Just returning to the same ‘space’ doesn’t magically erase
            or rewind those times.
        </p>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <h2 class="spacing">|</h2>
        <p>
            Therefore, repairing and rebuilding Gaza is not about returning to the original state where all the pain and
            amputations haven’t happened yet, but rather constructing the prosthetics that are layered and attached on
            top of these remaining stubs. This will evolve as an architectural project that is researching on the
            crafting of Gaza’s prosthetics in the context of the ‘re-build’, addressing the parallels and collision
            between bodily sensations, time, space and the act of repairing.
