        <b>Phantom limb pain</b> is more than a physical sensation; it is an <b>embodied trauma</b>, where the body
        remembers what
        has been lost. Similarly, <b>the act of digging</b> tunnels in Underground Gaza represents a collective response
        to the
        forced
        amputation of land, history, and community. Both phenomena <b>desire to reconnect one within the embodied
            memories</b> of
        nerve system, the other within the land, culture and home. Just as the body experiences pain in an absent limb,
        displaced
        communities instinctively carve pathways to reclaim their existence and familiarities they used to have. These
        acts reflect resilience,
        resistance, and the persistence of memory.

            <i>"Memory for Pain. The amputation of a limb represents a serious disruption of body integrity and is
                associated with a
                number of negative consequences, particularly disability and postamputation pain. (Fuchs et.al, 2018, p. 1)"</i>

            <i>"Several theories of chronic pain suggest that both declarative and nondeclarative memory processes
                contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain via neuroplastic changes in the nervous
                system [81–83]. One example for this process is central sensitization, referring to a hyperexcitability
                of the central nervous system and associated lowered pain thresholds [84]. In different groups with
                chronic pain, structural and functional reorganization within pain-processing brain areas has been
                shown, which might represent a neural correlate of pain memory [81, 85, 86].</i>
        </p>
        <p class="hidden-text">
            <i>Katz and Melzack [61] and Katz [87] proposed a crucial role of somatosensory memories for both PLP and
                nonpainful phantom phenomena (e.g., phantom limb awareness or phantom sensations). Anderson-Barnes et
                al. [88] suggested that phantom sensations could be explained by proprioceptive memories and that they
                might become associated with pain perceived before the amputation by means of learning mechanisms.</i>
        </p>
        <p class="hidden-text">
            <i>Melzack [61] suggested that pain prior to the amputation is encoded and can later be triggered, for
                example, by peripheral input stemming from the residual limb. This triggered preamputation pain is then
                experienced as PLP. Maladaptive plasticity that is positively correlated with PLP [65] can be seen as
                neural underpinning of pain memory in amputees. These processes might be more severe if chronic pain has
                already been present prior to amputation [81, 85, 86], potentially influencing the formation of a pain
                memory. </i>
        </p>
        <p class="hidden-text">
            <i>The theory of a relationship between pre amputation pain (that leaves behind a memory trace) and
                PLP is supported by retrospective reports that have shown similarities between memories referring to
                somatosensory perceptions in the affected limb in the phase before amputation and later phantom
                sensations [60, 61]. </i>

        The phenomenon of <b>phantom limb pain</b>, the lingering sensation of an absent limb, is not merely a neurological
        response to physical amputation but also a deeply <b>embodied trauma</b>, where the body and mind retain the memory of
        what was once there.
    </p>

    <p class="following-bodyparagraph">
        This pain could extends beyond the individual, metaphorically resonating within entire communities that have experienced forced
        separations from their familiarities. Similarly, <b>the act of digging</b> tunnels in Gaza emerges as a
        collective response to a different kind of amputation within land, history, culture, and
        freedom.

            Clay and soil layers that were dug and making subtracted spaces underground in the
            process of digging the tunnels around the Gaza could be considered as a sense of a material for craft,
            when it comes to a context of craftsmanship, a craft such as a pottery, which is a sense of vessel with
            hollow spaces left inside.

        Digging is more than a physical act, it could also be a metaphor for searching, or even investigating,
